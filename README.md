# Description

The ASAB tenant provides the capability to formulate electrolytes from up to 6 stock solutions, which may either be used in the assembly of coin cells or for analysis of their ionic conductivity. The measurement of ionic conductivity is achieved by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This tenant uses the version 1.1.0 of the Modular and Autonomous Data Analysis Platform (MADAP) ([https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8220661](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8220661), [https://github.com/fuzhanrahmanian/MADAP](https://github.com/fuzhanrahmanian/MADAP)) for the automated analysis of the obtained EIS data.
